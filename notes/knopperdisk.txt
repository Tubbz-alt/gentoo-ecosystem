From Wikipedia:

Knopperdisk is an operating system specifically designed for a USB pen 
drive and floppy disks. Knopperdisk is a fairly minimal, text system 
that can be used as a rescue disk, although the USB pen drive version
has a few more software packages installed which are used for different 
purposes.
Despite the similarity in name to Knoppix, it is based on Gentoo Linux.
